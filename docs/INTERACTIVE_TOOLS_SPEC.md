## Shared Implementation Patterns

### Data Capture Gate
All tools implement email/phone capture before showing full results:

```typescript
interface LeadCaptureGate {
  trigger: 'immediate' | 'after_calculation' | 'before_full_results';
  required: ('email' | 'phone')[];
  incentive: string;
  validation: ZodSchema;
}

// Implementation for each tool
const gateConfig = {
  constellation: {
    trigger: 'before_full_results',
    required: ['email'],
    incentive: 'Get your personalized action plan',
    showPhoneOptional: true
  },
  roi: {
    trigger: 'before_full_results', 
    required: ['email'],
    incentive: 'Download your ROI breakdown',
    showPhoneOptional: true
  },
  diagnostic: {
    trigger: 'before_full_results',
    required: ['email'],
    incentive: 'Get your leak-fixing checklist',
    showPhoneOptional: true
  }
};
```

### Analytics Integration
Each tool tracks detailed engagement metrics:

```typescript
interface ToolAnalytics {
  toolStarted: (toolId: string) => void;
  questionAnswered: (toolId: string, questionId: string, answer: any) => void;
  toolCompleted: (toolId: string, result: ToolResult) => void;
  leadCaptured: (toolId: string, leadData: LeadData) => void;
  ctaClicked: (toolId: string, ctaType: string) => void;
  resultShared: (toolId: string, platform: string) => void;
}

// PostHog events
const events = {
  'tool_constellation_started': { tool_id: 'constellation' },
  'tool_constellation_question_answered': { tool_id: 'constellation', question_id: string, answer: any },
  'tool_constellation_completed': { tool_id: 'constellation', score: number, tier: string },
  'tool_constellation_lead_captured': { tool_id: 'constellation', has_phone: boolean },
  'tool_constellation_sms_clicked': { tool_id: 'constellation', score: number }
};
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Initial Load:** < 200ms for tool UI
- **Question Transitions:** < 100ms smooth animations
- **Calculation Time:** < 500ms for all result computations
- **Result Animation:** 2-3 seconds total reveal sequence
- **Mobile Performance:** 60fps animations on iOS Safari

### Accessibility Standards
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full tab order through all tool interactions
- **Screen Readers:** ARIA labels for progress, results, and dynamic content
- **Color Independence:** Never rely solely on color for information
- **Text Sizing:** Readable at 200% zoom
- **Motion Preferences:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` settings
