# Project Scope: Samantha's Extreme Funnel Makeover

## One-Liner Summary
Build a private, alumni-only one-page offer for Samantha that replaces the old e-book lead magnet with a bespoke **vibe-coded custom tool**, sells a **$3,000 Extreme Funnel Makeover** (first 10 at **$1,500**), and routes every CTA to a pre-filled **SMS text to Samantha**.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Goal
Position a no-brainer, goodwill-driven offer that helps past clients reignite their book funnels by delivering a custom tool + rebuilt funnel, following Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers value equation.

### Success Metrics
- **30%+ opt-in rate** on interactive tools
- **5%+ SMS CTA click rate**
- **<3s page load time**
- **90+ Lighthouse scores** in all categories
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **WCAG AA accessibility compliance**

## Target Audience (ICP)

### Demographics
- Speakers, coaches, and authors Samantha previously helped become #1 best sellers
- Already invested **$10k–$30k** into self-publishing but stalled on monetizing the book/funnel
- Want leverage without heavy lifting; crave momentum and a fresh, modern funnel

### Pain Points
- Invested heavily but funnel performance stalled
- Free e-books no longer converting effectively
- Tech stack is dated and underperforming
- Audience/list has gone cold
- Lost momentum after initial book success

## Core Value Proposition

**"Turn your dormant best-seller into a lead-gen machine"** with a custom, on-brand interactive tool + rebuilt funnel that books calls and generates cash in weeks, not months.

### Value Stack Components
1. **Dream Outcome:** Re-activate audience, generate qualified leads, and book sales calls using a unique tool tied to their topic
2. **Perceived Likelihood of Achievement:** Proven track record (Samantha's alumni), done-for-you build, clear milestones, and social proof
3. **Time Delay:** 2–4 week sprint with a 48-hour interactive prototype
4. **Effort & Sacrifice:** Minimal—client provides book assets + approves copy; we handle the rest
